# C++ Academic Staff Database Project
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a database management system for academic staff, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The aim was to enhance my skills in developing complex software systems in C++. The project, optimized for Linux systems, showcases a blend of advanced C++ features, unit testing, and efficient data management techniques.
