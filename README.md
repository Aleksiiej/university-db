# C++ Academic Staff Database Project
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a database management system for academic staff, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The aim was to enhance my skills in developing complex software systems in C++. The project, optimized for Linux systems, showcases a blend of advanced C++ features, unit testing, and efficient data management techniques.

## Key Features:
- Object-Oriented Design: The system is architected using C++ object-oriented programming, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- CMake Integration: Utilizes CMake for project build management, demonstrating proficiency in modern C++ development practices.
- Unit Testing with GTest: Incorporates unit tests using the Google Test (GTest) framework, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the code.
- Data Management: Efficient handling of academic staff data, including storage, retrieval, and manipulation functionalities.

## Technical Stack:
- Language: C++
- Testing Framework: Google Test (GTest)
- Build System: CMake
- Development Tool: Microsoft Visual Studio
- Platform: Linux

## Project Goals:
- C++ Development Skills: Focus on deepening understanding of C++ and its application in real-world software development scenarios.
- Testing and Reliability: Emphasize the importance of writing maintainable and testable code using unit testing frameworks.
- Practical Software Engineering: Provide hands-on experience in designing and implementing a software system from scratch.
- Portfolio Building: Serve as a testament to my software engineering capabilities, suitable for showcasing in a professional context.

## Getting Started:
- Ensure C++ and CMake are installed on your Linux system.
- Clone the repository.
- Use CMake to build the project and run the tests using GTest.
- Start managing academic staff data with the program.
